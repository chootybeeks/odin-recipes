First HTML/CSS Project

This project will test my ability to create an HTML document
using skills I have acquired thus far, including committing with Git. I will revisit this document after I have made progress.

Iteration 1, I created the root file or index/homepage, and added a boilerplate to it.

Iteration 2, I created a second page for the site named Shrimp Salsa, and added a link to it on the homepage.
