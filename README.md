First HTML/CSS Project

This project will test my ability to create an HTML document
using skills I have acquired thus far, including committing with Git. I will revisit this document after I have made progress.

Iteration 1, I created the root file or index/homepage, and added a boilerplate to it.

Iteration 2, I created a second page for the site named Shrimp Salsa, and added a link to it on the homepage.

Iteration 3, I added an image of Shrimp Salsa to its page. I also added a bit of a description of what it is, along with a list of the required ingredients and the steps it takes to make the dish.

Iteration 4, was a lot of work, but all I did was add two more pages to the website. Each page has the same format as the first, so it was good practice. 

Overall, I am much more comfortable using git, and coding in HTML. I enjoyed this project thoroughly even though it was a ton of typing, repetition, and a bit time-consuming.
